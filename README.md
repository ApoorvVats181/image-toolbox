# Image Toolbox

A Python library for performing common image transformations like rotating, cropping, resizing, grayscale conversion, blurring, sharpening, and flipping. This library makes it easy to manipulate images using basic techniques, which are often required in various image processing workflows.

## Features
- Rotate images by a specified angle.
- Crop images to a region defined by coordinates.
- Resize images to specified dimensions.
- Convert images to grayscale.
- Apply blur effects to images.
- Sharpen images using a sharpening kernel.
- Flip images either horizontally or vertically.
